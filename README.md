# VidSplitter
###### This is one of my first Python projects, so expect heavy usage of libraries and copied code.



## How to use:
Install the requirements using the following command:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Drag the mp4 file you want to split into the folder containing your files, and run the next command:

```python
python3 vidsplitter.py
```
Answer the prompts it gives you, and the script will output your trimmed files in the same directory!
The times.txt file generated gives the timestamps(in seconds) that the video is trimmed at
